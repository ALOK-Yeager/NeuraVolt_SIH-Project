const FAQdata = [  { question:"What is an energy demand prediction model ?",  answer:"An energy demand prediction model forecasts future electricity consumption by analyzing past usage patterns, real-time data, and external factors like weather and socio-economic conditions. Using advanced algorithms, the model estimates how much electricity will be needed over various time frames. These predictions help utility providers optimize power generation, avoid energy shortages or overproduction, and ensure efficient distribution across the grid." } ,
                   { question:"How do historical data and analysis contribute to these predictions ?",  answer:"A peak prediction model specifically forecasts periods of maximum electricity usage, such as during extreme weather or high activity times. This works alongside the general demand prediction model, which estimates overall electricity consumption trends. Together, they provide a comprehensive forecast, allowing utilities to plan for regular demand while taking necessary precautions for peak periods, optimizing energy distribution and reducing grid stress."} , 
                   { question:" What factors are considered in the energy demand and peak prediction models ?",  answer:"These models consider multiple factors to predict energy demand and peak usage. Key inputs include historical consumption data, real-time weather conditions (temperature, humidity, wind speed), time of day, public holidays, large events, and population or industrial growth in different areas. Each of these factors affects electricity usage patterns, helping the models generate more accurate forecasts that account for daily, seasonal, and situational variations."} ,   
                   { question:" What type of analysis is involved in making predictions ?", answer:"Energy demand and peak prediction models rely on a combination of time-series analysis, machine learning, and regression techniques. Time-series analysis identifies trends over time, while machine learning models can process large datasets and adapt to changing patterns. Regression analysis helps correlate factors like weather with demand, and scenario analysis simulates different conditions to predict how these factors will impact future electricity usage."} , 
                   { question:"How does AI improve the accuracy of electricity demand predictions ?" , answer:"AI algorithms continuously learn from historical data and real-time inputs, improving prediction accuracy by identifying patterns and correlations that traditional methods might miss."}
